    "text": "Explore the data‑science lifecycle. The R for Data Science introduction models data science as a cycle: you begin by importing and tidying raw data; then understand it through an iterative loop of transforming, visualising and modelling; and finally communicate your results. Programming surrounds all of these steps and supports them. Today you will learn why each component is important and how they connect.\nRecognise the tools you need. To run the code in R for Data Science you need R, RStudio, the tidyverse package collection and a handful of other packages. We will install R (from the Comprehensive R Archive Network), download RStudio (an integrated development environment), and install the tidyverse.\nPrepare your computing environment. By the end of class you should have R and RStudio installed, know how to install and load packages, and be able to run simple R commands (arithmetic, vector creation, summary statistics). We will also introduce a dataset that you will revisit throughout the semester.",

    "text": "Notes\n\nThe data‑science workflow\nData science is not a linear process. You first import data from files, databases or the web; tidy it so that each variable is a column and each observation a row; transform, visualise and model your data in an iterative loop to understand patterns and relationships; and then communicate your findings to others. Programming is a cross‑cutting skill that supports each of these phases. Throughout this course, you will move back and forth between these steps rather than following them in a strict order.\n\n\nTools and setup\nYou need four things to run the book’s code: R, RStudio, the tidyverse and some additional packages.\n\nR is the programming language you will use. Download the latest version from CRAN at https://cloud.r-project.org. A new major version of R is released once a year, with minor versions in between; updating regularly ensures compatibility.\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Download it from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When you start RStudio, you will see a console pane for typing R code and an output pane for plots.\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages for data manipulation, visualization and programming. To install all core tidyverse packages at once, run install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in the R console. After installation, load the tidyverse with library(tidyverse); this attaches packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, stringr, forcats, lubridate, purrr and tibble. You only need to install a package once, but you must load it in each new R session.\nOther packages. We will occasionally use packages outside the tidyverse (e.g., palmerpenguins, nycflights13, arrow, rvest, duckdb). When you encounter an error that a package is not installed, run install.packages(\"package_name\") to install the package.\n\n\n\nInstalling and testing your environment\n\nInstall R and RStudio as described above. Accept the default installation options.\n\nInstall the tidyverse. Open RStudio and run the following in the console:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")   # installs core tidyverse packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)               \n\n\nTry basic R commands. Use R as a calculator and practise creating vectors and computing summaries:\n\n\n2 + 2                  # arithmetic\n\n[1] 4\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 7)  # create a numeric vector\nx * 2                  # vectorised multiplication\n\n[1]  2  4  6 10 14\n\nmean(x)                # compute the average\n\n[1] 3.6\n\nsum(x &gt; 4)             # count values greater than 4 (logical vector)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nNotice that R performs operations element‑wise on vectors, and the assignment operator &lt;- stores values. Use descriptive variable names and indent your code neatly; we will discuss code style in a later class.\n\n\nTake‑aways\n\nThe data‑science process is iterative, looping through import, tidy, transform, visualize, model and communicate. Understanding develops as you cycle through these steps.\nTo do data science in R you need the R language, the RStudio IDE, the tidyverse package collection and other supporting packages. Installing and loading packages early will save time later.\nR is vectorized: arithmetic operations and functions operate on entire vectors. Use the assignment operator &lt;- to store results and choose descriptive variable names to write readable code.",
